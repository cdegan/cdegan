Chiara obtained bachelor and master degrees in statistics at the University of Padova. She started her training as PhD student in April 2023 at the Leiden University Medical Center. Her project is funded by the LUMC and the NIH. 

From a mathematical and statistical standpoint, the focus of her study will be on developing novel statistical models in the field of longitudinal data. The main goal is to identify blood biomarkers that can be used to detect 
changes in the progression of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. To reach this goal, she collaborates with researchers from the Binghamton University (USA), Carleton University (Canada), Newcastle University (UK), and KTH-Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden).
